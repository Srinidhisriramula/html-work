    <h2 id="History">History</h2>
    <p align="justify">The town has a documented history of Lord Sri Rama temple constructed c. 17th century CE by
        Kancherla Gopanna.[4]
        Gopanna (1620 - 1680), popularly known as Bhadradri Ramadasu or Bhadrachala Ramadasu, was a 17th-century Indian
        devotee of Rama and a composer of Carnatic music. His devotional lyrics to Rama are famous in South Indian
        classical music as Ramadaasu Keertanalu, and have made Bhadrachalam a place of religious importance for
        Hindus.[citation needed]
        Bhadrachalam area also has several Hindu temples connected with epic Ramayana.[5] It is referred as "Dakshina
        Saketa Puri" in the movie "Sri Ramadasu".The history of the temple is closely linked to the history of Kancherla
        Gopanna. He was born in Nelakondapalli village of Telangana. His maternal uncle worked for Golconda Sultanate.
        As a famine swept through the region, the uncle appealed to the Sultan to give his nephew a job. Gopana was
        appointed as the tehsildar (revenue officer) of Bhadrachalam.[6] During the reign of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah – the
        last Sultan of Golconda (1672-1686) – under his orders, Gopanna enforced the Jaziya religious tax, a penalty
        designed to force Hindus to adopt Islam.[7] Gopanna received harsh criticism from the local Hindus for enforcing
        the tax. Dejected by numerous rebuffs, Gopanna decided to use a portion of the tax for the temple and face the
        consequences.[7] According to one version, Gopana built the temple using the taxes he collected. In another
        version, observing the dilapidated state of the temple, Gopanna repaired the temple for Rama with those taxes,
        and tried to offset the spent taxes by raising donations.[8]
        The temple was completed in second half of the 17th century at a cost of nearly six lakh varahas.[a][11]
        After learning the truth, the Shah was enraged, and Gopanna was summoned to the court. Gopanna explained that he
        never intended to misuse the treasury funds and planned to reimburse using donations he expected to receive in
        the future.[11] The Shah ordered his soldiers to hang Gopanna if the sum was not repaid within twelve years, and
        imprisoned him.[11] On the last day of the twelfth year,[11] According to one version of events at the end of
        the 12 year term, Rama and Lakshmana appeared in Shah's dream and repaid the entire sum in Rama madas (gold
        coins with Rama's inscriptions on them). When the Shah woke up, he saw real gold coins and released Gopanna.[12]
        According to another version, the Shah also gave Gopanna a pension for life and donated the area around
        Bhadrachalam as an endowment to the temple.[6] According to The Hindu, an Indian newspaper, some scholars
        dismissed the idea of Rama paying the money, saying that "Gopanna was imprisoned by his jealous enemies", and
        the Shah freed Gopanna after a fair inquiry, then sent him back to Bhadrachalam with due honors.[11] All these
        stories lack historical evidence, because Gopanna's 12-year confinement in Golconda prison by the Shah lasted
        till mid 1680s, closely coinciding with the Shah's rule of 14 years and the fall of Golconda Sultanate. The last
        known Golconda documents from the Shah's era are from 1686,[13] and over 1686–87, the forces of Mughal emperor
        Aurangzeb attacked Golconda over 8 months, fought with Shah's forces, then dismissed the Shah and imprisoned him
        in Aurangabad, as Aurangzeb sought to expand his control of the Deccan region.[14][15]
        According to another myth published in Indian newspapers and local publications, the 15th century Kabirdas – a
        Muslim saint – toured Telangana singing bhakti songs of Rama. The dedication and charity of the 17th-century
        Gopanna so impressed Kabir, that he gave him the title of Ramadas (Rama's servant).[8]
        According to the temple's history, after Gopana's death Tumu Lakshmi Narasimha Dasu of Guntur and his friend
        Varada Ramadasu of Kanchipuram offered prayers daily at Bhadrachalam and spent their life there. After Varada
        Ramadasu's death, Narasimha Dasu carried his corpse into the Godavari and died by drowning.[16]</p>

    <p align="justify">The temple and the lands were administered by Hyderabad state. In 1860, though the surrounding
        lands were given
        to British, the temple was retained with Hyderabad state in Warangal (later Khammam) districts. The lands,
        though under British rule, the rights of the lands were held with Palwancha samsthanam of Nizam state. Later,
        the lands surrounding the temple were merged into Khammam district in 1959.[17] The temple's maintenance and
        administration were undertaken by the endowment ministry of the Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1958. Repairs
        were made to the temple in 1960 under the supervision of the then-endowments minister Kalluri Chandramouli.[18]
        In August 1986 the temple faced a severe threat from flash floods in the Godavari River. The main streets and
        several structures, including cottages, were submerged in water for nearly five days. Many local people took
        shelter in the halls of the temple. The kalyana mandapam (marriage hall) was completely inundated except for its
        gopuram (temple tower). P. Seshacharyulu and other priests stayed in the temple and performed all the daily
        rituals without any interruption during the floods.[19]
        During the Telangana movement, both the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh claimed that the Bhadrachalam
        temple belongs to their respective regions. Telangana politicians and activists stood firm on their stance and
        stated that they would not let Bhadrachalam be separated from the state.[20][21] Bhadrachalam was retained in
        Telangana, and after reorganisation of districts in October 2016, the temple became a part of Bhadradri
        Kothagudem district.[22]</p>
